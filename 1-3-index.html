  <div class="center"><b>Introduction:</b></div>
<p>We study the enormous transformations that have occurred in society as a result of past forms of activism in practically every historical lesson from fourth grade onwards. I remember sitting at the back of my classroom at nine years old, stunned, reading about how Martin Luther King Jr. persuaded America to stand against the horrors of racial inequity; in sixth grade, reading about Stonewall. Even in AP European history, one of the most frustrating subjects known to man, I was fascinated by the suffrage movements of the early nineteenth century and the revolutionary fire that swept the globe in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>The thought that modern society’s  can be changed with one single idea, from one single person, seemed unfathomable. And the thought that I could make a difference? Simply inconceivable. I thought I wasn’t “worthy” enough to make a difference, and on top of that, I wasn’t old enough. All my ideas, everything I wanted to fight for had to be shelved until later… until I realized it didn’t. Youth activism is changing the course of American society. Kids all over the country, and even the globe, are taking stands for their beliefs, from creating walkouts to working to change laws. So how do we, the next generation, get a good grip on the future? How can we make the change via activism when weŕe so “young” in societyś eyes? Well, this article is a good place to start. With these 8 steps, you can take a figment of your imagination and transform it into a life-changing reality for many.</p> 

<div class="center"><b>The Planning Process</b></div>

            <p>Come up with a basic idea, Every Individual who’s changed history began with an idea or even a plethora of ideas. Change can come in many different forms, via podcasts, (if You’re interested, see how to podcast for a great in-depth explanation on getting started), walkouts, protests, videos, or films. Now, you may have some sort of idea of what you want to do; whether it’s to organize a walkout at your school or implement a new policy in your state. Though I can hear some of you saying “ I don’t have any ideas, I can’t think of a SINGLE thing”! If you fall into this boat, check out the "current oppurtunities for action" and “Current Issues” pages! It will provide information on opportunities that you can take part in. </p>
<p>You can also draw inspiration from these organizations you read about and apply it locally, perhaps via a local protest or school policy change. Once something sticks in your brain, think of it on a grander scale. How would you impact future generations and/or students? How necessary is your idea? One of the best ways to gauge this is by Talking to others; see how they feel about your mission and goal. ( keep some of these individuals in mind if you want to work collaboratively, too!) Even if the answers to these questions aren’t what you hoped for, you can still adjust and adapt your idea in different ways. In this stage, the most important step is to figure out the “Who’s”, the “Why’s” the “How’s” the “When/Where’s” and the “Whats” your idea entails. </p> 
<!-- A table will be listed below for you to copy and fill out with specific questions you can answer. Once you have a basic idea, you should move on to the next step. Our page includes tons of different information on student resources, how-to’s, and rules that could help you define these things, (some included below and throughout this article). -->
Here are some questions that may help you:<br>
  Who: who is your idea catering to? Who will your ideas impact? Who could Oppose Your ideas?<br>
  Why: why is your idea important? Why do you think others should care about your idea? <br>
  When and Where:  when will this idea take place? When will you start and finish your project? Where will this take place? What other places could it impact?<br>
  What: What will change? What will happen when you are successful? What reception are you anticipating?<br>
  How:How will you achieve  your goal? How long do you think it will take to achieve it? How will this idea hold up in the future?)<br>
<br>
  <b>2:    Research your idea:</b> <br>
 <p>Research is your most important step because it will set the groundwork for your project. if you plan to create a walkout; research walkouts regarding a similar premise and how they effectively achieved their goal. (If you need any walkouts/successful forms of activism to frame your reference, please visit the “<a href="2-2-index.html">Examples of Activism</a>” page on our website). Or, perhaps, study how some people ultimately DIDN'T achieve their goal. More specifically, see if there were any successful/unsuccessful forms of student activism in your state because it can give you key insight into how it was perceived by parents, local news outlets, etc in the past. If you plan to create an organization, research similar organizations led by students your age. If you plan to change or implement a law, research how laws change, what it takes to change, and WHY! </p>
<p>When researching other similar organizations, podcasts, Films, etc, keep in mind what issues they don’t address either. What groups/people are they forgetting about? What issues can you address that others have failed to? Keep a journal, binder, or online document of all your relevant research, of relevant organizations/ people, and refer to these often. If you filled out the table in the previous step, add your findings, expand it and change it. This will become especially helpful in the next step.  </p>
<br>
<b>3: Finalize your idea:</b> <br> 
<p>This step will require you to think of all the research you did and apply it to your idea. This is when we take your basic idea and make it into something more by thinking about all the kinks in your plan. What would someone who hates your idea say and Why would they say that? Make a list of people who might oppose your idea, and make a list of their biases and effective ways to address these biases. Will you take a Rogerian approach, and try to compromise? Or will you try for a more argumentative approach to stay true to your goal? </p>
<p>Think of any hole and try to fill it to the best of your ability; think of almost every problem and do your best to address it before making your idea something more. Be sure to understand the consequences of your plan and what it could mean for yourself and the others involved. I would recommend making a separate document and/or slideshow full of more refined notes for this; something you are comfortable with presenting to others.</p>



            <b>Taking Action:</b>

<b>4.  Building a Team: </b>
<p>Arguably one of the most important steps, a solid team is what will get you far. To effectively conduct a walkout, create an organization, or start an initiative takes a team. Your team should consist of at least 3 people. A team not only allows you to build and add to existing ideas, but it will also allow you to get different perspectives and deconstruct ideas in ways you couldn’t have alone. To stay in contact, one of the best things to do is to create a group chat and communicate often.  </p>


<b>5.  Developing your plan:</b> <br>
With your newfound team, you should devise a plan of attack. You and your team should devise responsibilities among yourselves- for example (forming a walkout), Two people should be in charge of an organization, another person spreading the word, and another person reaching out to news outlets, organizations, etc. Be sure to devise responsibilities that work with everyone’s normal day-to-today life and make sure you don’t overwork yourself and your team. Doing so may result in burnout, and this could result in someone quitting, or even worse, everything falling apart. More information on deciding jobs can be found on our “<a href="2-3-index.html">How to Delegate</a>” page. This is step one in devising a Bulletproof plan. Step two would be going back to your list of Who, Where, Why, When, What, and How's of your plan and see if everyone’s on the same page, or if there’s anything differently that must be done.<br>
 <p>You also want to establish when the event will be held and if it conflicts with any major school events that may cause students to not show up, any major holiday/state events that may cause the spotlight to be away from you. And most importantly, if the times establish conflict with you/ your team's schedule. Be sure to plan for the absolute worst; figure out if location status could change and or what to do in case of weather problems. Step three is reaching out to authoritative/ more established figures for help. Perhaps it’s a teacher, a pre-existing organization, or other leaders for help. If you are reaching out to your school, for example, be sure to save every email you and the school sends. This could help if any problems develop later. See some especially helpful pages below!</p>

<b>6. Spreading the word:</b> <br>
<p>Now that you worked out most of the kinks of your plan, focus on spreading the word. you can begin spreading the word via social media and word of mouth. Signs and posters made using art and photography, as well as videos and live presentations, may be highly successful; these are all abilities that young people can master. Teenagers have primarily led the use of social media to promote public awareness in recent years, and it is a great device for highlighting concerns and affecting change. Blogs, social networking sites such as Instagram, Twitter,  Snapchat, videos, memes, and online petitions are just a few instances of how words spread quickly online and may prompt swift and effective action. This process should start 2 weeks - a month in advance of your event, or even earlier depending on what you are creating. You can also reach out to other student activists and have them bump up your cause, or even cross-promote with other student activists. More specific tips can be found on the page below.</p>
How to spread awareness<br>

<b>7. Finalizing your plan + Setting it In Motion:</b> <br>
<p>Finalizing your plan is the most daunting but important step. For a public event, this is when you establish answers to things such as transportation arrangements, food arrangements, if/when news crews will show up, and things of the like. Be sure to establish who will lead the event and its message. For example, if you're speaking to a public audience, decide who will be best at delivering the speech. If you are organizing a protest, decide who will lead chants and talk to news crews. If you're recording a podcast, film, or using other electronic mediums, this might be the day before recording- getting props ready, checking all microphone settings, testing equipment over and over, making sure your background music is copyright free, etc.</p>
 <p>At this stage (roughly a day to a week before the main event), you should be smoothing out the details; not trying to rearrange or re-establish your foundation. Trying to change things such as dates, settings, or times at this point will often lead to stress or failure, so be sure to take the previous steps as seriously as possible. When the day comes, be sure you get plenty of rest the night before and rehearse and communicate with your team. Re-establish in your mind the points you want to make, and the key takeaways you want students and parents to ultimately take away. Be sure to take note of everything that happens and document it well, either through pictures, video recording, etc. </p>
<b>8. Thinking Of the Future: </b><br>
<p>If everything goes well, you'll want to maintain the momentum. Consider team expansion and a stronger social media presence as a few ways to keep your project sustainable. If you are doing an event, establish a time frame of the event recurring (will a similar event happen next year? The year after?) You want your project to be a long-term success. Investing money into developing your program, organization, or cause is a terrific method to be sustainable; but, this does not have to come from your wallet. Grants might help you support your project. A grant is a form of funding provided by the government or a company for your ideas and initiatives. The following article provides information on how to find grants to help your cause. </p>
