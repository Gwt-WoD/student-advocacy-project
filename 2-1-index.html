  Organizing an event is an important task to do to understand how an event is going to unfold.  The important questions of who, what, when, where, why and how are very essential to a protest’s success.  Who should be focused on who is being involved in your event, whenever that be who is on your side, who is on the opposing side, who isn’t being targeted.  Next is what is going on; what are you speaking up for?  Is it too specific or too unspecific?  Where is another important step, as getting everyone grouped together requires a space to do that, whether that be in person or online.  Why is it important to get more people on your side and to spread awareness of your topic?  Why should someone care about your topic?  Why does this topic matter?  How is another important step to be taken after you asked yourself the questions listed before.  How are you going to get your event spread to others?  How are you leaving an impact?  How are your actions going to make your actions leave an impact? <br>
	Who is relatively simple but responsible for much of an event.  Who are you sided with?  Who is helping?  Who are you arguing against?  These questions are the essential questions of an argument that might help yourself better understand what your goals should be.  If you don’t have someone to help you, remember this: one travels fast, many travels far.  Very few advocates would dare to go alone so be warned. <br>
	What is usually a mostly answered question that is important to think deeper about: What are you speaking against or for?  What is being said and what is not?  What should be emphasized?  These questions would give you a better understanding of what you are advocating for on the smallest levels and use those small level arguments to help you build a bigger argument with seemingly more impact than before. <br>
	Where (and usually when) are simply about planning for others and yourselves to get your ideas filled out as to what you can do.  Where (and when) are you going to be advocating?  Is this place and time good for you and the people you are with?  While when may not be needed for a self-sustaining website such as this one beyond a deadline, where and when are important to take account of when it comes to advocating for things such as marches and walkouts where time is needed so you don’t have a few small marches scattered around but one big, impactful march. <br>
	Why is another header of many considerations:  Why does your topic matter?  Why should someone be aroused by your topic?  Why should someone care about your topic?  Why may be similar to the what asked before but why asks you to figure out the reasoning you had behind your thoughts so you can properly advocate them to others. <br>
	The final and probably the most important step is the how.  How are you going to get people to join your cause?  How are you going to make a memorable impact?  How will your act spread?   These questions generate ideas as to how you should advocate and give you an idea as to where to go next.
