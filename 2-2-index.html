  <img src="photos/teenswhocare.png" style="width:500px;height:250px;"></img>
  <div>
<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic first hit, high school freshman Sameeksha Dangi grew eager to help her community; but after spending hours fruitlessly looking for volunteer opportunities, she couldn’t believe how difficult it was to find ways to give back. So, she decided to create one.</p>
<p>Sameeksha visualized having a non-profit website dedicated to making volunteering accessible to teens. To make her vision a reality, she researched, planned, communicated, and even hired a web designer to help create the website. Her work didn’t stop there--she then made sure to spread the word through PeachJar fliers, word-of-mouth, and Google Advertising. But most importantly, she maintained her long-term vision throughout all of the setbacks she faced.</p> 
<p>Teens Who Care has since provided volunteer opportunities to over 6,500 teens, who have helped over 6,500 people!</p>

  <div>
    <p>After struggling with feeling like her voice isn’t heard in the school system, Kaitlyn Johnson from Lake Stevens, Washington wanted to create a way for students to be involved in decision-making for her school district. So with the help of a couple of friends, she reached out to the Lake Stevens School board and created SACo (Student Advisory Council). This is a board of about 10 students who meet every month to discuss issues in the school district and how to address them in the best way possible for the students. They present their ideas and participate at the district’s board meetings to ensure that the input of the youth in the district is being heard by the staff that does the decision-making. Even though it has only been an active group for about a year now, the Lake Stevens SACo has already made changes for the better.</p>

<img src="photos/march.png" style="width:500px;height:300px;"></img>  
<p>On February 14th, 2018, a shooting took place at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High that claimed the lives of 17 people. Several of its survivors--including David Hogg, Emma Gonzalez, and Cameron Kasky--met up in the days that followed to create a strategy to prevent similar tragedies from happening. This is how they founded March For Our Lives: an organization devoted to protesting gun violence and to encouraging gun control laws. The students made speeches, appeared on television, and used social media to garner support. After only five weeks of swift, but careful planning, the students were able to gather over 800,000 people to march in Washington D.C., and they inspired over 800 global sister marches.</p>

<div class = "center"><b>1,000 Black Girl Books</b></div>
<img src="photos/1,000books.png" style="width:250px;height:300px;"></img>   
<p>Marley Dias, a 13-year-old, felt very frustrated with the lack of diversity in books she was reading in school. After realizing this frustration, Dias came up with the idea to start a book drive called #1000blackgirlbooks which is a drive that collects books featuring black females as the main character. Now, she has surpassed the 1,000 books goal and has now collected over 11,000 books which she hopes will not only bring more diversity to the books we read but also serve as more inspiring figures for black girls to look up to.</p>

<img src="photos/united.png" style="width:500px;height:250px;"></img>  
    <p>Throughout the early 2000s, more and more youth activists were inspired to join the fight to expand education access and legalization for undocumented immigrants. However, it wasn’t until 2007 that many of these activists decided to hold a national gathering to discuss issues related to their cause. At this gathering, they decided to create a powerful and united youth movement. Their goal was to create an organization that was both sustainable and engaging for immigrant youths. This is how United We Dream began. Since then, its over 700,000 members have continued to advocate for immigrants, and their campaigns have led to DACA being enacted!</p>

<img src="photos/FFF.png" style="width:250px;height:150px;"></img>  
<p>At just 15 years old, Greta Thunberg was determined to spark action regarding climate change. So in August of 2018, she decided to organize a strike at her school to encourage the Swedish Parliament to take action. But what began as a local effort, became a global effort. Thunberg spread her message through social media by starting #FridaysForFuture, and the hashtag quickly spread over many platforms. On the 15th of March, 2019, over a million young people, from 125 different countries, participated in over 2,200 strikes. Since that first strike, Fridays For Future has organized many more, similarly successful strikes. FFF’s efforts have helped millions of young people to stand up for their planet and have kindled an increased awareness of climate issues.</p>
