ok so this is the thing you read to get an idea of what we did or need to do
things to remember:
1:the links are now in file form meaning that you need to be careful with file names.
2:if the project says something along the lines of not found it's usually because you messed with index.html it NEEDS to be named that for replit to recognize it.
3:there are weird things happening with folders so dont organize things into them yet.
now on to naming:
H- is index related
N- is news page related
more to come
