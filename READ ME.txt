ok so this is the thing you read to get an idea of what we did or need to do
things to remember:
1:the links are now in file form meaning that you need to be careful with file names.
2:if the project says something along the lines of not found it's usually because you messed with index.html it NEEDS to be named that for replit to recognize it.
3:there are weird things happening with folders so dont organize things into them yet.
now on to naming:
_ is index related
N- is news page related
4:omg this actually worked this project is now an actual website its on cloudflare as https://student-advocacy-project.pages.dev you cant go to it on your chrome book but can check it out on your home computer
5:Made "UniversalMenu.css" to hold the shared .css stuff that is used everywhere for the menus.  I will try to do the same with the HTML files but I'm not really sure how

^^^don't do the html files thay are actually different pages so that makes cloudflare able to treat it as 3 pages now

IMPORTANT BUGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED

Is the header and body supposed to be with the navbar or can i just put that back in the main page index?
