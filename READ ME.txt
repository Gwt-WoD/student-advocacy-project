IMPORTANT PLEASE READ!!!
to anyne reading this in the future the way to redeploy the website is to replace the current github project with a different copy if you see this on github go to https://replit.com/@PAULRODEHEAVER/student-advocacy-project#READ%20ME.txt and copy it then git hub repository it and use that in the website. if you have ANY QUESTIONS contact me at 624449@lkstevens.wednet.edu and once you figure it out. Be sure to pass it on.
!!!


ok so this is the thing you read to get an idea of what we did or need to do
things to remember:
1:the links are now in file form meaning that you need to be careful with file names.
2:if the project says something along the lines of not found it's usually because you messed with index.html it NEEDS to be named that for replit to recognize it.
4:omg this actually worked this project is now an actual website its on cloudflare as https://student-advocacy-project.pages.dev you cant go to it on your chrome book but can check it out on your home computer
