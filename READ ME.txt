ok so this is the thing you read to get an idea of what we did or need to do
things to remember:
1:the links are now in file form meaning that you need to be careful with file names.
2:if the project says something along the lines of not found it's usually because you messed with index.html it NEEDS to be named that for replit to recognize it.
4:omg this actually worked this project is now an actual website its on cloudflare as https://student-advocacy-project.pages.dev you cant go to it on your chrome book but can check it out on your home computer
5:Made "UniversalMenu.css" to hold the shared .css stuff that is used everywhere for the menus.  I will try to do the same with the HTML files but I'm not really sure how

^^^don't do the html files they are actually different pages so that makes cloudflare able to treat it as 3 pages now

^^^Got the UniversalScript.js to add the menu in everywhere the same menu.  It is definitally a real mess but I couldn't find a better way (I was going to have it just copy and paste everything in UniversalMenu.html onto every page but that doesn't quite work)

IMPORTANT BUGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED

  
  it is actually being pasted to every document so that it just clears up nicer also now since we have universal style we can delete evry single style EXCEPT THE _style.css that has some poorly named/unamed classes so as soon as they are named it will work
