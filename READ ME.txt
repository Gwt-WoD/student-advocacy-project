IMPORTANT PLEASE READ!!!
To anyone reading this in the future. If you want to edit this project then copy the repl.it project at https://replit.com/@PAULRODEHEAVER/student-advocacy-project. In this new version, compile it using verson control to a github repository. Then ask Ms. Guilfoil to open cloudflare. Replace the old github repository in the website's pages tab with the new github repository. 

If you have ANY QUESTIONS contact me at 624449@lkstevens.wednet.edu

Once you figure it out. Be sure to pass it on. Please also try to explain it better.

Things to remember:
1:The links are in file form so you need to be careful with file names.
2:If you run the project and it says something along the lines of repl not found it's usually because you messed with index.html it NEEDS to be named that for replit to run.(If you have this by clicking a link it's probably named wrong.) PS:Other files are juust named index for no real reason.
