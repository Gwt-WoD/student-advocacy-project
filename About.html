  We are The Student Initiative, a small group of AP Language students located in Lake Stevens, Washington, that identify with the goal of providing young minds with the means to act on what they are passionate about. Activism is a very complicated ordeal, and without proper leadership or guidance, it is easy for students and young people everywhere to fall short of what they want to achieve. Our organization found its inspiration in that very issue due to multiple instances of local activism focused on community change. Starting out, our group was kept a secret from administration to avoid confusion regarding our goals, and though we are now known by our high school, our vision means not affiliating with those  that might fear the youths’ voice as a challenge to authority. We of The Students Initiative, are determined to making sure young minds around the world have the means to avoid failure and achieve greater changes in their communities that can be sustained.<br>
<br>
<b>Why did we create this website?</b><br>
Student Perspective 1: As a young person, it is necessary to have a community where you can speak your mind and make impactful changes. Our website is not only accessible but also gives teens a way to connect and stand up for their rights. Teens are frequently dismissed and ignored when attempting to speak up for themselves, so our website gives teens an outlet to express their ideas and create awareness for their causes. <br>
<br>
Student Perspective 2:  Our website is important to use because it can help people have the confidence and knowledge to stand up for different problems in the world that need fixing. It describes how students can peacefully speak up about current issues. While in school, I have noticed issues with walkouts and protests. Our website can be an important way to educate people on effective ways to protest and speak up. <br>
<br>
Student Perspective 3: Our website is an outlet for all the students to learn about successful activism, giving students an easily accessible, usable, and comprehensible source to learn about the rights they have and what form of action they can take. As a student in America, I frequently hear my peers discussing various issues they’ve experienced at school ranging from teacher behavior to other students, or even larger issues such as sexual and physical misconduct. Sadly, that’s the extent of these discussions, My peers are either unaware or fearful to bring these issues to school boards as they aren’t educated on what they can do. By creating this website we are giving a powerful voice to the students across the globe.  <br>
<br>
Student Perspective 4: Young activists need to learn to use their voices to impose effective change and awareness. Often, when inexperienced activists organize or participate in various demonstrations, they can be unsuccessful, whether caused by poor communication, conflicting messages, or ineffective demands. Through the many different topics compiled into our website, activists are able to learn how to be successful in their attempts to push for change and their voices.<br>
